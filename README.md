# SoftCoreCompare

Running the program SoftCoreCompare.py will eventually use a dialog box to select a
number of various RISC-C and other small soft cores to be compared  when synthesized
by Yosys to several FPGAs (and later translated into just NAND gates and also into
chip layouts by OpenLane 2).

Once the data is collected there will be options for generating reports in the form
of LaTex compatible tables and graphs.

## License

While the "MIT license" is used for the original material in this project, each soft
core is in the form of Verilog files copied (and sometimes slightly patched) from
various projects. These files use the license of the project they came from.
